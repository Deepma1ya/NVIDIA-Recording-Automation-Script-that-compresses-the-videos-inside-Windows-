# NVIDIA-Recording-Automation-Script-that-compresses-the-videos-inside-Windows-
A Windows Batch automation script that processes NVIDIA ShadowPlay / GeForce Experience / Nvidia App recordings using HandBrakeCLI.  This script is written and maintained by me, while HandBrakeCLI is a third-party tool and full credit goes to its original developers.

⚙️ Uses HandBrakeCLI for video encoding/conversion

🪟 Designed specifically for Windows
